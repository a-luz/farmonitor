# farmonitor

Undergrad project created with the intention of learning more about the GUI and database interface in racket.
It is an application to keep track of Cows and Oxes in a farm, in order to better manage a milk producing farm.

The app is basically a CRUD with some auxiliar functions. It has some statistical functions in order to help the management of the farm. The statistics functions generate .xsl files, which can be read with the help of an internet browser.
